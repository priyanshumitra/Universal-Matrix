# Universal-Matrix
Hello Everyone, Today I made another project that is related to the Universal Matrix which perform as 2D(Two Dimensional). In this project, there are 10 different types of matrixes that you can perform operations with. Basically, there are 15+ types of matrixes, but most of the uses of matrixes in DSA are 10 types of matrixes, which are already available in this project.

This Project is very beneficial for DSA Students because the all concepts related to the Matrix and Arrays which are are the main part of DSA are coverd in my project.

The Most Importent Matrixes which are cooverd in My Project are,

1.Addition Matrix

2.Subtraction Matrix

3.Multiplication Matrix

4.Division Matrix

5.Transpose Matrix

6.Upper Triangular Matrix

7.Lower Triangular Matrix

8.Diagonals Matrix

9.Tri-Diagonal Matrix

10.Null Matrix

Note:- I didn't include Sparse Matrix because Diagonal Matrix and Sparse Matrix have not much difference because Sparse Matrix means, Most of the elements in the Matrix is Zero and less Non-Zero elements in that so, Diagonal Matrix has also moest of the elements Zero and less Non=Zero elements. And other types of Matrixes are mostly addicted to the  Mathematics and not most usable in the field of DSA and Programming so, I didn't include these in My Program. And I made This Program in Three Programming Languages which are C++, Python and Java for your better understanding of my project in different programming languages.


If, You have any enquiry related to this Program, Please let me know.

Thank You.....
