# Universal-Matrix
Hello Everyone, Today I made another project that is related to the Universal Matrix. In this project, there are 10 different types of matrixes that you can perform operations with. Basically, there are 15+ types of matrixes, but most of the uses of matrixes in DSA are 10 types of matrixes, which are already available in this project.
